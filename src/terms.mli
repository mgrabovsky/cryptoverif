(* [match_AC_advice match_term explicit_value get_var_link is_var_inst next_f prod allow_rest_pat allow_full allow_rest l1 l2 state]
   matches the lists [l1] and [l2] modulo AC. 
   When [allow_rest] and [allow_rest_pat] are false, it calls [next_f [] state'] after linking variables in [l1]
   so that [\sigma l1 = l2] modulo AC. 
   When [allow_rest] is true and [allow_rest_pat] is false, it calls [next_f lrest state']  after linking variables in [l1]
   so that [\sigma l1 . lrest = l2] modulo AC. 
   When [allow_rest] is false and [allow_rest_pat] is true, it calls [next_f [] state']  after linking variables in [l1]
   so that [\sigma l1 = l2 . lrest] modulo AC. [lrest] is ignored, it is not passed to [next_f].

   [allow_rest_pat] is true when a subterm of the pattern in [l1] should match
   [l2], so that some elements of [l1] are allowed to remain unmatched.

   In case [allow_rest_pat] is true, [allow_full] is true when [l2] may match the full list [l1], that is, [lrest] may be empty.

   [allow_rest] is true when the pattern in [l1] should match a subterm of 
   the term in [l2], so that some elements of [l2] are allowed to remain unmatched.

   [match_term], [explicit_value], [get_var_link], [is_var_inst], [prod] 
   are as in the function [match_assoc_advice_subterm] above.
